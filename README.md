# Web-Scrapping-Project-Goodreads

Web scrapping Goodreads website to get information about books awarded under Goodreads 2019 Choice Awards. In total there are 20 genres, and each genre in turn has 20 books.

I used Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scrapping through Python. The following data was scrapped:

Name of genres under Choice Awards
Name of books awarded under each genre
Author name, Votes Received, Book URL, Rating of each book
